# Trigger Sequencer

<img src="trigger-sequencer.JPG" width=500>

An 8-step / 6 channel trigger sequencer with a pushbutton interface. Trigger width is controllable by the knobs, from a narrow trigger to a gate that can be . . . pretty wide. (a half-second? a second?)

The Trigger Sequencer WILL NOT DO ANYTHING without its sibling the Bounce Sequencer: https://github.com/508-loop-detected/bounce-sequencer

All of the actual logic is in the Bounce Sequencer, which connects via expansion bus on the back.
